# micro SD card extension cord
I designed this little tool while compiling a software installation on BeagleBone Black. I needed to repetitively remove/inset the micro uSD card. The BeagleBone was installed in a hard-to-reach area. So much time was wasted trying to inset the card with tweezers. 

This simple tool plugs into the hard-to-reach socket, and provides a flexible extension.
